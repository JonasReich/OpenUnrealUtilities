/**
 * Request object that represents a request from one component to another.
 * One possible application for requests are blueprint callbacks where a C++ system makes a request and binds to the
 * OnCompleted delegate and a blueprint fulfills the request, which calls the previously bound callback.
 *
 * Requests can succeed, fail or be canceled and may be reset and reused after completion.
 * A request can be triggered multiple times from multiple sources, but will only propagate the first of these calls.
 * This is useful in many situations, e.g. save requests. If this is not sufficient and you need a request that will be
 * acted on for each individual call, consider using a UOUURequestQueue instead.
 *
 * Request payload data should be added as class members of child classes and can be set up with bidirectional
 * read/write access (from caller to responder and vice versa).
