# Open Unreal Utilities

![OUU logo](./Resources/ouu_wide.png)

The Open Unreal Utilities plugin is a collection of general purpose utilities in Unreal Engine developed by Jonas Reich and colleagues.

I'm developing it during my day job(s) and squeeze all the small utilities in here that don't feel big enough for dedicated plugins and
that are relatively generic and should prove useful for almost any game project.

Some of those smaller utilities have since grown to the point where I decided to move them to dedicated plugins (e.g. JSON data assets have been moved to [OUUJsonDataAssets](https://github.com/JonasReich/OUUJsonDataAssets)).

## Contents

### Modules

The plugin is divided into several modules for different application purposes:

| Module                  | Description  |
|-------------------------|--------------|
| **OUUBlueprintRuntime** | Blueprint exposed functionality that is already present in C++ UE4 off-the-shelf. e.g. build configuration info, direct ini settings access, world context resolution, class/object flags, lexical string operators, message log printing, platform process invocation, etc. |
| OUUDeveloper            | Developer tools, esp. debug commands that are available in editor and development builds |
| OUUEditor               | Blueprint function libraries for editor utilities |
| **OUURuntime**          | The core of the plugin. These are runtime utilities that are also available in shipping builds. These utilities should be useful in all kinds of different contexts ranging from container templates, execution flow helpers, etc |
| OUUTests                | Automated tests that test the plugin functionality. Only contains private content. _You will never need to reference this from other modules!_ |
| OUUTestUtilities        | Test automation tools. Especially utils to manage worlds for automation tests and some macros to reduce boilerplate code.  |
| OUUUMG                  | UMG Widgets and UI implementation helpers. <br> Most of these tools were deprecated in favor of UE5's CommonUI plugin. |

Most of the documentation of how the open unreal utilities are used are provided as source code comments and automation tests in the ``OUUTests`` module.

### Runtime Features

The **bold** features are the big ones that I most reccommend you to try the plugin for:

## Versions

### Plugin Versions

Plugin versions are flagged with tags. Check the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/JonasReich/OpenUnrealUtilities/releases) for a brief summary of changes between versions. [master](https://github.com/JonasReich/OpenUnrealUtilities/tree/master) always points to the latest release.

> Latest plugin release: [v1.3.0](https://github.com/JonasReich/OpenUnrealUtilities/tree/v1.3.0) on [master](https://github.com/JonasReich/OpenUnrealUtilities/tree/master)

If you want stable versions, you should stick to the labeled release commits on the master branch.

### Unreal Versions

Active development happens on branches named by supported engine version (pattern: ``ue<major>.<minor>``, e.g. ``ue5.0``).

Multiple version branches may receive updates at the same time, e.g. even after the UE 5.0 release, I keep adding features to ue4.27 that are infrequently cross-merged to the ue5.0. This is because I'm still actively using the plugin on projects that do not always upgrade to the latest UE version.

> **active development:**
> **[ue5.2](https://github.com/JonasReich/OpenUnrealUtilities/tree/ue5.2)**
> **[ue5.3](https://github.com/JonasReich/OpenUnrealUtilities/tree/ue5.3)**
>
> old versions (not supported anymore):
> [ue4.25](https://github.com/JonasReich/OpenUnrealUtilities/tree/ue4.25),
> [ue4.26](https://github.com/JonasReich/OpenUnrealUtilities/tree/ue4.26),
> [ue4.27](https://github.com/JonasReich/OpenUnrealUtilities/tree/ue4.27),
> [ue5.0](https://github.com/JonasReich/OpenUnrealUtilities/tree/ue5.0),
> [ue5.1](https://github.com/JonasReich/OpenUnrealUtilities/tree/ue5.1)

I'm generally avoiding to merge back from higher engine version branches to lower engine version branches to guarantee asset compatibility.

### Deprecation

Any major changes to the API will be assisted via the use of deprecation macros so you have time to upgrade your code.
Deprecations are phased out alongside with new minor version upgrades of Unreal Engine.

For example, changes introduced for UE5 that deprecate old types were marked with ``UE_DEPRECATED(5.0, "...")``.
These warnings may be removed as soon as I upgrade the plugin to support UE5.1, so at that point any code referencing the
deprecated symbols or headers will no longer compile.  

## Automated Testing

A big majority of the utilities has unit tests that can be executed via the Session Frontend from within Unreal.
These tests are written with the help of testing utilities contained in the OpenUnrealUtilitiesTests module.
Said testing utilities are prepared for usage in other plugins or game code. The actual tests should serve as examples how
both the testing utilities as well as the targeted components are meant to be used.

### Getting Started (with Automated Testing)

If you want to use the testing utilities, it should be sufficient to

- include OUUTestUtilities.h and
- add the OUUTestUtilities module to the private dependencies of the module implementing the tests

### Overview

The automation testing utilities contain the following components:

- **FAutomationTestWorld** is a utility object that allows creation of a simple world and game framework objects for tests
- **AutomationTestParameterParser** is a utility object for complex automation tests that allows easy parsing of test parameters
which are supplied as a single FString per test case
- **CollectionTestFunctions** are test functions similar to the FAutomationTestBase member functions TestTrue(), TestEqual(), etc.
that allow comparing collections to expected result values while adding some additional checks and error messages to aid in debugging failed tests
- **OUUTestMacros** is a collection of macros that simplify the creation of tests
	- ``OUU_*`` macros help declaring test cases with significantly less redundancy/boilerplate compared to test declaration macros provided out-of-the-box
	- ``SPEC_TEST_*`` macros are wrappers for test functions to be used in [Automation Specs] without adding duplicate descriptions for every test (see below)
- **UOUUTestObject and UOUUTestWidget** are not-abstract classes derived directly from UObject and UUserWidget respectively available to use in tests

### Automation Specs

Unreal Engine v4.22 added a new test type called [Automation Spec](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Programming/Automation/AutomationSpec/index.html)
following the [Behavior Driven Design (BDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) methodology.

I am convinced this new approach of writing tests is better than the previous one, so most of the plugin tests are written as specs adhering to
the engine source code convention of placing specs in ```*.spec.cpp``` files. In cases where special test objects are required that need reflection code generated by
UHT, I put those into a FooTests.h header file next to spec file.

The macros used to define the specs are very lightweight and add minimal boilerplate, so I did not see any reason to add any macros for creating spec classes.
There is a set of macros for calling test functions though that wrap the automation test member functions as well the collection test functions added by the plugin.
All of these macros are prefixed with ``SPEC_TEST_`` so they are easy to recognize and auto-complete. The macros do not introduce any hidden logic (early returns, etc),
but they auto-fill the test function description which is passed as "What" parameter. The aim when using these functions is to enforce that test descriptions should be
part of the expectations formulated using Describe and It, so the actual test calls should not need any additional descriptions.

Whenever you run into instances where the description of the test case is not sufficient to explain the call of test functions,
it's a good sign that you should either rephrase the description or break the test case down into separate smaller test cases
that are easy to describe.

## Coding Conventions

The plugin adheres to the [Open Unreal Conventions](https://jonasreich.github.io/OpenUnrealConventions/) which are extended
coding conventions based on Epic Games' coding guidelines. 

Some plugin specific conventions:
- Types or functions that are not namespaced which are likely to cause naming conflicts with future engine types or third/project code should be prefixed with OUU
- The full name of the plugin 'OpenUnrealUtilities' should be avoided to keep type names short and consistent
- All module names in the plugin must start with OUU prefix to make them easily distinguishable in Dependencies lists of Build.cs files
